With this initiative, we aim to revolutionise the agriculture sector by building a strong farmer network across India and attempting to merge farming with technology. We essentially included a whole package solution for a farmer to start using new agricultural technologies, a social media-like portion where farmers can connect with their neighbouring community farmers, and an agriculture expert section where farmers can ask questions about their issue. Also, we have created a local news section where customers may access all local agricultural news and keep up with various government initiatives. Additional features include a product area where farmers will receive product recommendations based on their experiences, the ability to upload a leaf image and receive information about diseases (which will be implemented), and the ability to determine the best crop for their location (which will be implemented). Our resource page is a crucial component where farmers may learn new farming methods, increase yields, and discover how to cultivate new crops.
